# appeals-x-twitter
My appeal to x Twitter 

I want to still post on X. I am an artist and a musician and this is my art and my art is my life and I need the X library and studio to have free speech.

Legally I could make a anonymous account and only work on 15 out of the 25 projects I am working on.

I am an artist and am working on a lot of projects and albums that people may not understand right now because it is real art.

Legally I need X to allow me to create my parody Disney Kingdom called DumboDisney Productions. 

I do own HonorCitizenPUB a publishing company and am producing all my words and art and creations through HonorCitzenPUB.

My art and music is already on all your media platforms
